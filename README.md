Retail inventory management is the process of ensuring you carry merchandise that shoppers want, with neither too little nor too much on hand. By managing inventory, retailers meet customer demand without running out of stock or carrying excess supply.

In practice, effective retail inventory management results in lower costs and a better understanding of sales patterns. Retail inventory management tools and methods give retailers more information with which to run their businesses, including:

Product locations
Quantities of each product type
Which stock sells well and which doesn’t, by location and sales channel.
Profit margin by style, model, product line or item
Ideal amount of inventory to have in back stock and storage
How many products to reorder and how often
When to discontinue a product
How changing seasons affect sales

♣️PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This dataset contains a lot of historical sales data of a Brazilian top retailer

Inventory analysis helps you determine the right amount of stock to keep on-hand to fill demand while avoiding spending too much on inventory storage. Inventory is an asset on a balance sheet and represents the product a company plans to sell to its customers eventually

What is the purpose of store inventory? A store inventory is a record of all the items available for use in your daily business operations. The store inventory increases with purchases and decreases with sales or consumption. It is important to track changes in your inventory so you can evaluate business performance, set future plans or detect theft.
